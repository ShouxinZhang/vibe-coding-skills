Be good at leveraging resources and tools made by others; at the same time, when we build tools, we should consider ease of use for others.

In the process of solving problems, frequently save our own ideas and others’ experiences, and build them into our own knowledge system and methodology.

Continuously explore in depth to enhance the depth of our knowledge and thinking. Communicate with others often, and ask more questions like “Why can’t we do it this way?” and “What would happen if we did it like this?”

Before doing things, clarify what our goals and requirements are. For example, if we want an internship in a certain role, what is that role currently doing, what tech stack does it use, what are its pain points and needs, and how can we meet those needs?

User experience, cost, and efficiency are the three fundamental elements of business—how well does our development work deliver on them?
