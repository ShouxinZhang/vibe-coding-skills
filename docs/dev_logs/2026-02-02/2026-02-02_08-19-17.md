## Task: Improve exporter UX (cache + ZIP progress)

### Business Perspective
- **Objective**: Make documentation exports reliable and fast for teams.
- **Outcome**: Added persistent caching so repeated exports don’t re-fetch pages, and added visible progress during ZIP generation.

### Changes
- Updated `ExamplesStudio/BrowserAutomation/TampermonkeySidebarMarkdownExporter/sidebar-markdown-exporter.user.js`
  - Added cache controls (enable + TTL hours)
  - Added persistent cache storage (Tampermonkey storage with `localStorage` fallback)
  - Added “Clear cache” action
  - Added ZIP generation progress using `JSZip.generateAsync(..., onUpdate)`
- Updated `ExamplesStudio/BrowserAutomation/TampermonkeySidebarMarkdownExporter/README.md` with cache notes.

### Advantages
- Faster repeat exports and less load on doc sites.
- Better UX for large sites because ZIP stage is no longer “black box”.

### Disadvantages
- Cache consumes browser storage; users may need to clear it.
- Some doc sites may still require custom DOM selectors for best content extraction.
