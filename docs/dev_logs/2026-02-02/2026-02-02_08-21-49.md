## Task: Parallelize exporter to speed up large sites

### Business Perspective
- **Objective**: Reduce end-to-end export time for large documentation sites.
- **Outcome**: Added concurrency-limited parallel fetching/conversion while keeping output ordering stable.

### Changes
- Updated `ExamplesStudio/BrowserAutomation/TampermonkeySidebarMarkdownExporter/sidebar-markdown-exporter.user.js`
  - Added "Concurrency" setting to the panel.
  - Implemented `mapWithConcurrency()` worker pool to fetch/convert pages in parallel.
  - Kept filenames and `index.md` deterministic (based on original sidebar order).
  - Kept downloads sequential to avoid browser throttling, but still benefits from parallel fetch/convert.
- Updated `ExamplesStudio/BrowserAutomation/TampermonkeySidebarMarkdownExporter/README.md` to document concurrency tradeoffs.

### Advantages
- Significant speedup on sites with many pages.
- Less waiting time improves adoption for team documentation snapshot workflows.

### Disadvantages
- High concurrency can trigger rate limiting or increase load on the docs site.
