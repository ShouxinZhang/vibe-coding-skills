## Task: Make ZIP download reliable (manual link)

### Business Perspective
- **Objective**: Ensure users can always retrieve the exported ZIP even if the browser blocks programmatic downloads after long-running async tasks.
- **Outcome**: Added an explicit in-panel download link that works via a user click, while still attempting auto-download for convenience.

### Changes
- Updated `ExamplesStudio/BrowserAutomation/TampermonkeySidebarMarkdownExporter/sidebar-markdown-exporter.user.js`
  - Added a hidden download row that appears when ZIP is ready.
  - Created a persistent object URL for the ZIP and binds it to a “Download ZIP” link.
  - Keeps best-effort `a.click()` auto-download.
- Updated `ExamplesStudio/BrowserAutomation/TampermonkeySidebarMarkdownExporter/README.md` with browser download notes.

### Advantages
- Reliable delivery of exported ZIP across browsers.

### Disadvantages
- Manual click may still be required depending on browser policy.
