## Task: Fix ZIP progress “stuck at 0%” and reliability

### Business Perspective
- **Objective**: Make ZIP export predictable and usable even for large documentation sets.
- **Outcome**: Added a fast ZIP mode (no compression) to avoid long stalls, improved UI progress updates, and added clear error handling.

### Changes
- Updated `ExamplesStudio/BrowserAutomation/TampermonkeySidebarMarkdownExporter/sidebar-markdown-exporter.user.js`
  - Added ZIP mode selector: **Fast (STORE)** vs **Small (DEFLATE)**.
  - Enabled `streamFiles: true` and used lighter compression level for better responsiveness.
  - Yielded once before ZIP generation so the UI can repaint.
  - Throttled ZIP progress updates via `requestAnimationFrame`.
  - Wrapped ZIP generation with try/catch and user-facing notification on failure.

### Advantages
- ZIP export works better for large sites; less “0% forever”.
- Clear recovery path: switch to Fast mode or lower concurrency.

### Disadvantages
- Fast mode produces larger ZIP files.
