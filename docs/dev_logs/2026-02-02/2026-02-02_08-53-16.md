## Task: Fix "stuck 0%" ZIP generation

### Business Perspective
- **Objective**: Ensure the ZIP exporter actually finishes and provides progress feedback even on large datasets.
- **Outcome**: Changed file addition to be incremental and removed problematic JSZip options to stabilize the generation phase.

### Changes
- Updated `ExamplesStudio/BrowserAutomation/TampermonkeySidebarMarkdownExporter/sidebar-markdown-exporter.user.js`
  - Refactored: Files are now added to the `JSZip` object **immediately** upon fetching/conversion, instead of waiting for the end. This reduces the heavy "pre-generation" overhead that caused the 0% stall.
  - Removed `streamFiles: true` which could be problematic in some browser/Tampermonkey environments.
  - Increased `setTimeout` yield to 50ms before ZIP starts to ensure UI repaints.
  - Reverted to direct DOM updates for progress instead of `requestAnimationFrame` for the ZIP phase, ensuring visibility even if the thread is busy.
  - Added internal console logging (`[VCS]`) for easier debugging in the browser console.

### Advantages
- Much smoother transition from "Fetching" to "Zipping".
- More stable and observable ZIP generation.
